Maybe the atmosphere there is too thin, maybe the gravitational pull means that this thing doesn't have enough power to actually get off the ground. I took a chance, because I am such a big fan of The Mandalorian and want to style a jet pack like Din Djarin. I will let you all know how it goes once I test this thing in the field.",
